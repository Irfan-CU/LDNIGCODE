# LDMIGCODE

LDMI framework is a prallel slcing framework for 3d printers that generates the printing instructions for a 3D printer.
As an intial step tthis tool coverts input solid in hermite set of data and point clouds. This data is stored in pixels with required infromation about the solid model.
Using this point cloud guidelined are sent to 3d printer for printing.
